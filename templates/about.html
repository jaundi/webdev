                  <h3>Education Background</h3>
                  <p> I completed by bachelors degree in Electrical and Communication Engineering from Moi University
                    in the year 2010.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Work Profile </h3>
                  <p>After graduation from the university, I began my career with Huawei technologies in the year 2011 as an operation and planning engineer
                    where I was in charge of delivery billing systems at customers site and supporting the same untill the system was stable.I worked here for one year before
                    moving on to join Safaricom PLC in 2012 as a system support engineer. I was responsible for infrastructure and service maintenance.I have delivered on several
                    projects to boost system capacity and overseen the move to cloud of the billing system. This has shappned my skills in infrastructure management and service deployments
                    that I have done hundreds of times. In the year 2020, I took a different route from what I have been doing for the past 8 years and joined a Devops team as an 
                    engineering lead responsible for delivery a monitoring and observability tool in the miscroservices space a role I currently hold.
                  <h3>DevOps Journey</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have been working on legacy systems since I started my career in the year 2011. I really enjoyed my work but it become too routine and less challenging.In 2018
                    , the section I used to work in was moved to Digital Information Technology section. I got a chance to interact with technologies like public cloud, kubernetes, docker and miscroservices and 
                    this really fascinated me. I challenged myself and began my DevOps journey by learning python and the different DevOps tools out there. In the past three years I have been shappening
                    my skills on tools like ansible, terraform, kubernetes and docker. I know I have a long journey but I am extremely excited to continue down this road as it is challenging and I learn
                    new things on a regular basis.
